AIM: Make a front-end app using the existing back-end system


Github repository (made public):
https://github.com/TMaz1/MDA_Project.git


Made use of native-base framework
    Particularly for the styling aspect


Style guide: JavaScript
    All code is written as if it is one person writing it
    Spacing and brackets are similar
    Lowercase named files
    Variable names are camelCase except the variables interacting with the API (easy for me to understand)
    etc.
No linter was involved

Extension task "Profanity Filter" is loosely attempted
    displays a ToastAndroid if user is typing the words "cakes", "tea" or "pastries"
